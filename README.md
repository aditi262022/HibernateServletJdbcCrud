It is a project showcasing robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Java technologies - Hibernate, Servlets, and JDBC, structured within an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. 
This endeavor aimed to create a seamless interaction between a web application and a relational database.

The project's foundation lies in Hibernate, enabling efficient object-relational mapping (ORM) by bridging the gap between Java classes and the database schema. Leveraging Hibernate's power, 
I designed a versatile Employee entity with attributes like ID, name, address, salary, and company details.

Servlets were employed to handle HTTP requests and responses, providing a sturdy foundation for the web layer. JDBC, acting as the underlying mechanism, facilitated direct interaction with the database, 
enhancing data management capabilities.

The MVC architecture was embraced to maintain a clear separation of concerns. The models encapsulated data logic, Hibernate aided in persisting objects, and Servlets managed client requests and directed responses, 
ensuring a streamlined flow.

Implemented CRUD functionalities allowed for seamless data manipulation. From inserting and fetching employee details to updating and deleting records, each operation was meticulously crafted for efficiency and accuracy.

This project amalgamates the prowess of Hibernate's ORM capabilities, the agility of Servlets for web handling, JDBC's database connectivity, and the structural clarity of MVC architecture. 
It stands as a testament to my proficiency in Java-based technologies and my ability to design and execute robust, scalable solutions.
